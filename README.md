# Web Scraping with Python

This lesson teaches people with basic Python knowledge the tools and libraries to do web scraping, which means extracting data from websites. It has three episodes.

Episode 1 begins with an introduction to how websites are structured using HTML. You’ll learn how to explore this structure using your browser and how to extract information from it using the BeautifulSoup package.

In Episode 2, you’ll learn how to retrieve the HTML of a webpage using the requests package and continue practicing how to parse and extract specific content with BeautifulSoup.

Toward the end of the workshop, in Episode 3, we’ll explore the difference between static and dynamic webpages, and how to scrape dynamic content using Selenium.

This workshop is intended for learners who already have a basic understanding of Python. In particular, you should be comfortable with:

-   Install and import packages and modules
-   Use lists and dictionaries
-   Use conditional statements (if, else, elif)
-   Use for loops
-   Calling functions, understanding parameters/arguments and return values
